It uses tags to organize text into sections that define their presentation on a browser.\n\nHereâ€™s a basic breakdown of its key components:\n\n1. **<HTML Tag**: This is the main container for all content.\n2. **HEAD Section**: Contains meta tags (for page properties) and stylesheets.\n3. **BODY Section**: Contains the visible content of the webpage.\n4. **Elements**: Enclose data such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, forms, etc., with attributes describing their properties.\n\nFor example, a simple HTML structure looks like this:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<head>\n    <title>My Page</title>\n</head>\n<body>\n    <h1>Hello World!</h1>\n    <a href=\"#\">Link to another page</a>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nHTML is often paired with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity. Itâ€™s the foundation of web development, allowing creation of dynamic and interactive websites.",
